Corporate Taxation and Evasion Responses: Evidence from a Minimum Tax in Honduras  [Draft available soon]

(with Felipe Lobel and Pedro Zuniga)

[Selecting Top Bureaucrats: Admission Exams and Performance in Brazil](https://github.com/thiagoscot/website/blob/master/SelectionAtTheTop_DahisSchiavonScot_SIOE2020.pdf) 

(with Laura Schiavon and Ricardo Dahis). 

*Abstract: In the absence of strong incentive schemes, public service delivery crucially depends on bureaucrat selection. Despite being widely adopted by governments to screen candidates, it is unclear whether civil service examinations can predict job performance. This paper investigates this question by focusing on a highly prestigious and influential set of bureaucrats in Brazil: state judges. We first explore data on judges' monthly output and cross-court movement to separately identify what share of observed performance is explained by judges and courts. We estimate that judges account for at least 23% of the observed variation in the number of cases disposed. Using a novel data set on examinations, we then show that, within cohorts of candidates taking the same exam, those with higher grades perform better than their lower-ranked peers. Our results suggest that competitive examinations can be an effective way to screen candidates, even among highly qualified contenders.*

[Political Selection and Bureaucratic Productivity](http://documents1.worldbank.org/curated/en/573111544644789517/pdf/WPS8673.pdf) 

(with James Habyarimana and Stuti Khemani). World Bank Policy Research working paper; no. WPS 8673.

*Abstract: Economic theory of public bureaucracies as complex organizations predicts that bureaucratic productivity can be shaped by the selection of different types of agents, beyond their incentives. This theory applies to the institutions of local government in the developing world, where nationally appointed bureaucrats and locally elected politicians together manage the implementation of public policies and the delivery of services. Yet, there is no evidence on whether (which) selection traits of these bureaucrats and politicians matter for the productivity of local bureaucracies. This paper addresses the empirical gap by gathering rich data in an institutional context of district governments in Uganda, which is typical of the local state in poor countries. The paper measures traits such as the integrity, altruism, personality, and public service motivation of bureaucrats and politicians. It finds robust evidence that higher integrity among locally elected politicians is associated with substantively better delivery of public health services by district bureaucracies. Together with the theory, this evidence suggests that policy makers seeking to build local state capacity in poor countries should take political selection seriously.*

## Work in Progress
Targeting in Tax Compliance Interventions: Experimental Evidence from Honduras \[[AEA RCT registry](https://www.socialscienceregistry.org/trials/5285)\] (with Giselle del Carmen and Edgardo Enrique Espinal Hernandez). 

*Abstract: The use of letters informing taxpayers about audit probabilities or filing deadlines is popular among tax authorities (TA) and has been shown to positively impact tax compliance. When improvements in information collection are not accompanied by audit capacity, nonetheless, TAs face a credibility issue: informing taxpayers about knowledge of their wrongdoing and not following up by punishing non-compliers erode the credibility of the TA. Jointly with Honduras' Revenue Administration Service (SAR) we will randomize around 30,000 taxpayers into receiving detailed information about the tax authorities' knowledge on their operations before the filing deadline. Using rich administrative data on taxpayers' previous characteristics and behavior, we then aim to estimate heterogeneous treatment and use those to inform future targeting.*
